# C# Code Style Guidelines

## Naming Conventions
- **Classes and Interfaces**: Use PascalCase for class and interface names.

## Additional Best Practices
- Use expression-bodied members for concise property getters and small methods.
- Always use an underscore prefix for private fields (e.g., _sampleField).
- Prefer using var only when the type is obvious from the right side of the assignment.
- Classes and Interface use PascalCase for Class and Interface names.

## Additional Clarifications
- Always prefix private fields with an underscore (e.g., _myField).
